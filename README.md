# Website

This is the code for my website sitting at https://www.chris-bacon.co.uk. It's using [Hakyll](https://jaspervdj.be/hakyll) to generate static HTML files.

## Compile + Build

Running `make build` will compile and build the website into the `_site` directory, ready to deploy.

Running `make deploy` will deploy the compiled `_site` directory.

## Watch

Running `make watch` will watch for changes and load them locally.
