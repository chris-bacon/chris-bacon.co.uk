<h3>About Me</h3>

<p>I drink too much coffee&mdash;black coffee, though, which must count for something&mdash;and spend too much time thinking about esoteric subjects. I can provide a list of people to blame for that. I enjoy science fiction/fantasy, meandering thoughts about mind, type-systems, and gazing at the stars, amongst other things.</p>

<p>My coffee addiction is funded by the fact that I'm a programmer, perhaps because philosophy and linguistics don't buy enough coffee. Either way, this seemed like the most natural choice given my background, which is a BA in Philosophy and Linguistics and an MA in Linguistics, specialising in syntax.</p>

<header class="header__main"><h4>Tech</h4></header>
<p>I mainly use a combination of neovim, tmux, and zsh. You can find my dotfiles here: <a href="http://github.com/chris-bacon/config">dotfiles</a>.</p>
